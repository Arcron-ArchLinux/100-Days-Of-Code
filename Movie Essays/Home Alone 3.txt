In Home Alone 3.
The sequel to Home Alone 2: Lost In New York.
In this movie a international terrorist organaisation in North Korea have heard about the secret mission of the U.S Airforce their complany Axus which has developed a one of a kind chip 
it is top secret but someone in the Axus company told this to the North Korean terrorist organaisation about it this chip is special because if it is installed in a bomb it can destroy
everything near it so the organaisation decides to hire four people from U.S to help them get the chip.
They bribe a employee in Axus company to give them the chip he agrees and in the dead of night they get the chip when they are in the car they need to get back to North Korea but incase
the airport security saw the chip they would be arrested so they hid the chip in a remote control toy car to bypass the security and they do but they put the car in a packet which was
very common at the airport so they mixed up actually a old woman mistook it for her bag then one of the terrorist says to board the flight to Chicago because now was its boarding time so
they went to Chicago there the old lady went into the cab and they just missed it then one of the terrorist takes a photo of the number plate with a secret camera in his gloves they 
rented a house to track the cab and look at their luck they spotted the car immediately and they went their but it was a man who came out of the cab so they asked that where was the lady
and where did she live the old man told them where she lived and so they started to track.

We shift to a different scene, a boy called Alex is cleaning her drive way because snow is filled there and when he has done he asks for his payment but she says she does not have
anything but she does give him the remote control toy car which has the SECRET CHIP so he takes it the next day Alex is looking with his telescope and sees those terrorists but little 
did he know he saw them break into her house and they start searching for it but Alex calls the cops but the terrorists run away just in time and her mother and he also has to 
apologize to the cheif police.

What I really like about this story that Alex the 8-year-old boy has everything under control and gets those international terrorists into jail and they have burned hair bruised heads
which happened because of Alex's traps.

Watch the full movie to find out what happens next.
